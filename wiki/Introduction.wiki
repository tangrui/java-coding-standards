= Introduction =

The purpose of this document is to examine Java coding standards and conventions used throughout industry and to indicate the standards we adopt and practice.

Alot of coding standards and conventions come from the development method/style that the developers use. Overtime some of these conventions and standards can become obsolete in favour of other standards.

== Why Have Code Conventions ==

 Program comprehension is very important in relation to software development. 

 Having code that is easy to comprehend greatly helps with development and maintenance of the software and having good coding standards can help achieve this.
